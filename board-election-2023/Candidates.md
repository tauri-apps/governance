<!-- Opening -->

Hallo! I'm Robin van Boven (@Beanow), a software engineer based in the Netherlands. Currently I'm a Tauri Board Director, employed by CrabNebula, and would love to continue for another term as a Board Director.

<!-- History with / relevance for Tauri -->

About 2Â½ years ago I helped with establishing the [Tauri Programme][statutes] and joined as a Board Director. Some of the areas I worked on during this term are:

- Created processes and templates for the Board, to follow regulations more easily.
- Made sure we have multiple admins on important services (reducing our [bus factor] risk).
- Proposed and co-authored the ["Domains and Teams" governance model][governance].

<!-- What you bring to the table -->

My strengths and what I would bring to the Board are:

- Passionate about the fairness, openness and resilience of Tauri.
- Regular time dedicated to _doing work_ for the Board.
- A critical opinion based on experience in open source and software teams.

<!-- Future for Tauri; What you're interested in realizing next term. -->

I believe my skills are best used to strengthen what we do internally. Improving the foundations for other contributors to rely on. Some areas I would work on if elected for another term:

- Investing in the new governance model, making sure we use it effectively.
- A campaign to improve transparancy on all fronts, including a much more visible Board.
- Make it significantly easier for the Working Group to submit proposals to the Board.

A strong internal focus for me personally. Of course there is more to discuss, so I'd be happy to keep sharing my opinions and support other initiatives.
