# Candidate introductions

Candidates for the [2024 Tauri Board elections](README.md).

## Daniel Thompson-Yvetot

I am one of the co-creators of Tauri and I have been a member of the Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy board since its creation. I have helped us acquire both EU and UK trademarks, and see myself as a steward of the Tauri community. I am a public speaker, and go on stage / podcasts multiple times per year to talk about Tauri and OSS communities. I am a champion for open source and community building. In my life I have spent over 20,000 hours as a volunteer in charities, like Tauri - and I would like to candidate for the incumbent seat on the board. I have two cats, live in Malta, and am happy to answer any questions you might have.

## Lucas Nogueira

I am Tauri's co-founder together with Daniel. I've been leading the developing side of the project since 2019, contributing over 2500 commits over the past 5 years. I will always contribute to Tauri and I would like to continue my work in the Tauri board so we can shape its future in favour of the community.
